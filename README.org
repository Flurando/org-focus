* org-focus

a cleaned up version of gh-org, publish to github while using github workflow to hide unnesassary files.

* aim

provide an easy showcase for written org files

for example, you have some fan fictions written in org

mmm, well, that's me to some extent

* usage

just write your stuff in org here, they will be made html as is

feel free to tweak the config.el, or just remove it if you would like to use the default one

to include css, images or similar stuff

create a folder called static

everything in it should be in the web folder exactly as is

might overide the output of your org files if they happen to be the same

see the workflow file for details

since the static folder functionality is not tested, if it does not work as intended, open an issue.
