* org-focus

a cleaned up version of gh-org, publish to github while using github workflow to hide unnesassary files.

* aim

provide an easy showcase for written org files

for example, you have some fan fictions written in org

mmm, well, that's me to some extent

* usage

just write your stuff in org here, they will be made html as is

feel free to tweak the config.el, or just remove it if you would like to use the default one

to include css, images or similar stuff

just keep it in the repo as you like

since all files or folders would be copied as is to the github page branch

if they

1. not start with a dot
2. not end with .org

However, this github action garenteened functionality is *untested*

so if it does not work as I described above, open an issue please.
